# Highlights

* `juse` is an [AMD][] inspired JavaScript framework to load and manage modules and dependencies.
* `juse` adds additional features on top of the base [AMD][] API to support modular design such as module stereotype and grouping.
* `juse` provides core framework modules as services to assist with the additional design features in module definitions.
* `juse` makes it easy to separate common reusable patterns from application modules into its own framework modules.
* `juse` also provides framework modules as API abstraction of system resources such as DOM and XMLHttpRequest.
* `juse` supports easy integration with external classic frameworks such as [jQuery][].
* `juse` is compatible with mainstream browsers including IE9+, as well as [Node.js][].
